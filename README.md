### Author: [Truce](https://www.twitch.tv/truc_e)

## Description
This adds Twitch integration to Super Mario 64. Meaning commands are added that change various things in Super Mario 64. Viewers of the stream can spend bits to get points and use points to use commands.

### Commands can be customized in the config, default commands are listed here:
- !mario | Returns Mario to his default state
- !luigi | Turns Mario to become taller, skinnier, and floaty physics
- !wario | Turns Mario to become short, fat, and heavy physics
- !waluigi | Turns Mario to become taller, skinnier, and purplier. Having never having a game of his own Waluigi doesn't know how to control, so he has inverted controls
- !sonic | Mario turns blue and no longer has a speed cap
- !neon | Mario becomes neon and has random physics
- !vanish | Toggles Vanish cap
- !metal | Toggles Metal cap
- !wing | Toggles Wing cap
- !cap? | Toggles one of the 142 random variations of cap
- !oof X | Takes X amount of health from mario
- !speed+ X | Adds X forwards speed to Mario
- !speed- X | Adds X backwards speed to Mario
- !upward X | Teleports Mario X upwards
- !cannonCam X | Adds X seconds to the CannonCamâ„¢

## Config
### Options
- username | Set this to the username of the account that will be sending and receiving messages. (The bot account)
- password | *NOT THE ACCOUNT PASSWORD!* This is the oauth password. This can be foung at http://twitchapps.com/tmi
- channel | The name of the channel the bot will be connecting to.
### Points
- startingPoints | How many points a new user starts with.
- subMultiplier | The multiplier of how many points a sub will get for each bit. **subMultiplier: 2** means subs will get 2 points for 1 bit.
- modMultiplier | The same as subMultiplier but for moderators instead. If a user is both a mod and a sub they will have whatever multiplier is higher.
- modCanManagePoints | Whether or not mods can give, take, and set point values for viewers.
### Commands
Each command has a name and a point value. i.e. **"luigi": 10** This means the command that turns Mario into Luigi is called !luigi and costs 10 points to use. These commands must be lowercase but using commands is not case sensitive.
argCommands are a little different instead of having a one time cost they cost the amount of points specified for each number. i.e. **"oof": 10** would mean that **!oof 1** would cost 10 points and **!oof 4** would cost 40 points
